This is the library ScaFaCoS ("Scalable Fast Coulomb Solver").

ScaFaCoS is a parallel library for solving the Coulomb problem. It
provides various state-of-the-art methods with a common interface.

Further details on the project, downloads, online documentation 
as well as support contact data are given on the project's web page

The Git repository at https://github.com/scafacos/scafacos.git uses
submodules to integrate the sources of the PFFT and PNFFT libraries.
To clone the entire ScaFaCoS repository including the submodule sources,
use the command

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/scafacos/scafacos.git

or to update the missing submodules sources (i.e., after normal cloning)

  git submodule update --init --recursive
